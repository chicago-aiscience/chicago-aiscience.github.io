This page details the goals and services offered by the Research Software Engineer to help guide and support Schmidt Fellows in their research software development.

# Goals

:::{card}
1. **Establish high-quality research codebases** that are well organized, documented, and designed for long-term use and collaboration.
2. **Promote sustainable development practices** that ensure research software is open source, reproducible, resilient to failure, and adaptable to future research directions.
3. **Support reproducibility and transparency** by connecting software versions, workflows, and outputs to research results that can be rerun and validated over time.
4. **Showcase Fellows’ software products** through an accessible online repository of research outputs that highlights reusable tools, workflows, and contributions.

# Services

The Research Software Engineer can help in a variety of ways and can support Schmidt Fellows across the full lifecycle of their research software, from early design decisions to preparing code for public release. This includes help with:

- Debugging and testing
- Structuring and refactoring codebases
- Defining development practices that support reproducibility and long-term maintenance
- Integrating tools such as version control, continuous integration, and automated workflows
- Data handling and workflow inputs/outputs
- Running code on local machines, clusters, or cloud environments
- Evaluating or adopting new libraries and technologies

These examples are intended as a starting point rather than a limitation.

# Project Intake

```

In addition to office hours, we use a project intake form to help guide larger or longer-term research software engineering projects and collaborations.

The form collects information about your technical goals, timelines, and software needs so we can better understand the scope of the work and plan appropriate support.

Submitting the intake form helps ensure that requests are aligned with Fellowship expectations and allows us to prioritize effort, coordinate resources, and set realistic next steps for sustained collaboration.

# Diffusive Instabilities in Dusty Disks

> Authors: Konstantin Gerbig

{button}`GitHub Repository <https://github.com/KonstantinGerbig/diff-inst>`

*Fast, reproducible 1D axisymmetric experiments for the diffusive instability in dusty disks ([Gerbig et al. 2024](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1114), Gerbig & Lin, submitted), including an incompressible, viscous gas that responds azimuthally and couples to the dust via drag backreaction.*

This page details the goals and services offered by the Research Software Engineer to help guide and support Schmidt Fellows in their research software development.

# Goals

:::{card}
1. **Establish high-quality research codebases** that are well organized, documented, and designed for long-term use and collaboration.
2. **Promote sustainable development practices** that ensure research software is open source, reproducible, resilient to failure, and adaptable to future research directions.
3. **Support reproducibility and transparency** by connecting software versions, workflows, and outputs to research results that can be rerun and validated over time.
4. **Showcase Fellows’ software products** through an accessible online repository of research outputs that highlights reusable tools, workflows, and contributions.

# Services

The Research Software Engineer can help in a variety of ways and can support Schmidt Fellows across the full lifecycle of their research software, from early design decisions to preparing code for public release. This includes help with:

- Debugging and testing
- Structuring and refactoring codebases
- Defining development practices that support reproducibility and long-term maintenance
- Integrating tools such as version control, continuous integration, and automated workflows
- Data handling and workflow inputs/outputs
- Running code on local machines, clusters, or cloud environments
- Evaluating or adopting new libraries and technologies

These examples are intended as a starting point rather than a limitation.

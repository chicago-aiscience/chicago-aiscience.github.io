# Lesson 1: GitHub Actions introduction with a full example

This lesson will cover an introduction to GitHub Actions and will walk through a full example to introduce the various components and terminology.

***Objectives:***
- Understand what GitHub Actions is and what types of tasks it can support
- Review a full working example to understand the pieces of a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline as a high level overview - There is no need to dive into the specifics quite yet!
- Understand GitHub Actions quotas and limitations

> GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
-- ["Understanding GitHub Actions"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/understand-github-actions)

But what does that mean for a scientific algorithm or workflow?
- How does this apply to scientific code that is not published as a package?
- How do you tie code changes to results that are then referenced in a publication?
- How do you support reproducible execution?

A GitHub Actions workflow is a YAML file that defines automated tasks to run in response to events like pushes, pull requests, or manual triggers. GitHub Actions workflows can be used to support reproducible science in existing code bases borrowing from traditional deployment practices followed by Python package developers.

🧰 Throughout this workshop, remember: workflows define _when_ automation runs, jobs define _what_ runs, steps define _how_ it runs, and actions package reusable functionality that steps can run. This will become more clear as we work through examples.

[This GitHub repository](https://github.com/chicago-aiscience/workshop-sst) contains implemented best practices and forms the foundation for the RSE workshop series. It contains:

- A toy, working example of predicting climate patterns in the tropical Pacific Ocean from sea surface temperature data. It is simple but demonstrates some key operations found in scientific algorithms: Data source aggregation, data processing, and data visualization
- A fully defined GitHub Actions workflow following best practices and version control. (Does require use of GitHub secrets which is a more advanced topic.) [Full GitHub Actions definition file](https://github.com/chicago-aiscience/workshop-sst/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- GitHub templates for issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Key documents that support open source code development: code of conduct and collaboration expectations, license information, a README that details use, citation file
- Python package style organization: All processing code is defined in a `src` directory with a separate `tests` directory for unit and integration testing
- GitHub pages documentation site in the `docs` directory
- `Dockerfile` to build a containerized executable of the code SST processing code
- Branch protections and other GitHub repository settings that support the long term development and maintenance of the codebase

This workshop focuses on GitHub Actions workflows for reproducible science and so primary interest may lie in [the definition file]( https://github.com/chicago-aiscience/workshop-sst/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml). Let's walk through some of the workflow sections to better understand what you can do with GitHub actions and how it supports our goal of tying versions of code to results.

## Workflow set up

Set the name of your workflow:
```yaml
name: Deploy SST
```

Define when the workflow is triggered:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ dev, main ]
```
- You can automatically trigger workflow execution using different event types. In this case you can trigger it to run when ever a commit is pushed to the `dev` or `main` branches
	- [Documentation for the `on` keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#on)
	- [Documentation on event types](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows)

Only let one instance of the workflow execute at a time:
```yaml
concurrency:
```
- [Documentation on concurrency ](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#concurrency)

Define environment variables for the entire workflow:
```yaml
env:
```
- [Documentation on environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#env)

## Jobs

This sets up jobs to execute steps in the workflow:
```yaml
jobs:
```

## Lint and Format Job

The lint and format job uses `ruff` to lint and format the code base. Both linting and formatting are about code quality and help maintain a codebase over time keeping the code "clean" and formatted through versions.

A linter will analyze code and flag bugs, error-prone patterns, unused variables and imports, violation of code rules.

A formatter rewrites your code's layout so it follows a standard style around indentation, spacing, line breaks, quote style, and brace placement.

```yaml
  lint-and-format:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
```

This repo uses `ruff` for both linting and formatting. [The Ruff Formatter Documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/)

## Scan Job

The scan job scans the code base for any security vulnerabilities and reports on them in the `Security` tab in the GitHub repository. This ensures anything to deploy to a HPC cluster, the cloud, or collaborators' laptops does not include vulnerabilities that could impact computing and risk data breaches.

```yaml
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      security-events: write
    steps:
```

This repo uses GitHub's code scanning. [GitHub code scanning documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning)

## Test Job

The test job executes existing unit tests located in the `test` directory on multiple Python versions using a `matrix` (more to follow in the workshop). This ensures any changes you made does not break previous functionality and execution of the code is performing as you would expect.

```yaml
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10","3.11","3.12"]
    steps:
```

## Version Job

This step is a little bit complicated as version control can be hard! This steps takes the version as defined in the `pyproject.toml` file and updates it based on the current branch (as determined by the push trigger). So this job locates the next version of the application. This is super helpful in tying results to code as a version provides a numeric tag which can be used to identify code modifications and supports the creation of a release (the last step in the workflow).

```yaml
version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      app_version: ${{ steps.dev.outputs.app_version != '' && steps.dev.outputs.app_version || steps.release.outputs.app_version }}
      deploy_env: ${{ steps.dev.outputs.deploy_env != '' && steps.dev.outputs.deploy_env || steps.release.outputs.deploy_env }}
      dev_ran: ${{ steps.dev.outcome == 'success' && 'true' || 'false' }}
      release_ran: ${{ steps.release.outcome == 'success' && 'true' || 'false' }}
      bump_type: ${{ steps.dev.outputs.bump_type != '' && steps.dev.outputs.bump_type || steps.release.outputs.bump_type }}
    steps:
```

## Build and deploy job

This job builds a Docker container, tags it with a specific version, and deploys it to the [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry). The resulting containerized executable captures a fixed snapshot of the code _and_ its dependencies, ensuring it can be run consistently across different environments.

By versioning and hosting the container alongside the codebase, you create a stable, citable artifact that can be referenced to **reproduce the exact computational results used in a publication**. This makes it possible to rerun analyses, regenerate figures, and validate results long after the original development environment has changed—supporting transparency, reproducibility, and long-term research integrity. (Plus it is automated so you don't have to manually build a container with each release.)

```yaml
build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [lint-and-format, scan, test, version]
    if: needs.version.result == 'success' && (needs.version.outputs.dev_ran == 'true' || needs.version.outputs.release_ran == 'true')
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    steps:
```

## Release job

The release job creates a release in the GitHub repository. A release generates compressed archives of your codebase that capture all modifications at the time the release is created. You can also include release notes, a list of contributors, and links to binary files. [See the documentation for more information](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).

This is really helpful for tying specific code modifications to results. By associating a particular version of your code with a release, you can support reproducible executions of your algorithms and reference that exact version in a publication. In our example, the release does not include a full executable since we rely on the container image for that, but it does allow us to retain compressed source archives that can be used to reproduce results from a specific version in the future.

```yaml
release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [version, build-deploy]
    permissions:
      contents: write    # required to push commits/tags
    if: needs.version.outputs.dev_ran == 'true' || needs.version.outputs.release_ran == 'true'
    steps:
```

## Documentation job (BONUS)

You can create Markdown files to document how to install, set up, and use your codebase. These files can include Jupyter notebooks and detailed descriptions of specific functions or methods that align with content in a publication. You can also automatically generate documentation that includes function signatures, arguments, and return values. All of this documentation can be hosted on a [GitHub Pages website](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

This is bonus content and is considered slightly more advanced! It will not be covered in this workshop but is shared here as it is a part of the complete example.

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy Documentation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths-ignore:
      - pyproject.toml
      - uv.lock
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
```

## GitHub Actions quotas and limitations

GitHub Actions usage is free for **public repositories**. Any usage beyond this is billed to your account. See [billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions) for more information.

The limitations are detailed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/limits) and include:
- 2,000 minutes for workflow execution
- 500MB of artifact storage
- 10GB of cache storage
- A workflow execution limit of 35 days
- Each job in a workflow can run up to 6 hours
- A default concurrency limit of 20 jobs

If your account does not have a valid payment method on file, usage is blocked once you use up your quota.

You can check your quota usage for a repository under the `Insights` tab by navigating to "Actions usage metrics."

## Summary

In this lesson, you were introduced to GitHub Actions and how workflows can be used to automate common tasks in a repository. Rather than focusing on syntax, this lesson emphasized building a mental model for how automation runs in GitHub and how these pieces fit together.

You also explored why GitHub Actions are useful in the context of scientific and research codebases, where reproducibility depends on being able to rerun the same steps in a consistent way over time. By the end of this lesson, you should be comfortable recognizing the main components of a GitHub Actions workflow and understanding their roles, even if you are not yet writing workflows from scratch.

You can now explain what GitHub Actions workflows are and identify the core components of a workflow.

## Next steps: A simpler example

The full example is pretty complex! For this workshop, we will use a simpler version that still includes all of the pieces from the complete example, but lets you start simple and add one piece at a time. The workshop content will also highlight checkpoints in the code  and point out (🔍) how to modify GitHub actions for existing code so that it may be applicable to your own codebases.

# Lesson 2: Getting started and defining a workflow

This lesson will cover how to get started with GitHub Actions starting with some background information on YAML and the structure of GitHub Action workflow files. The lesson will then cover how to create your first GitHub Action workflow definition file and introduce key components as we add various operations to the file.

***Objectives:***
- Create a `pyproject.toml` file to support project versioning
- Define an initial GitHub Actions workflow file with a name, when it should be triggered, and permissions
- Define a "Lint + Format" job that lints and formats the code base
- Define a "Version" job that provides versioning for the project

## YAML and defining a GitHub Action workflow

GitHub Action workflows are defined in YAML. YAML is a human-readable data serialization standard. It includes a syntax that relies on indentation and key-value pairs. It represents data structures like lists (sequences) and dictionaries (mappings).

🧰 A YAML file indents can be defined with tabs or spaces but by convention it is best to define indents with two spaces.

Example list

```yaml
fruits:
  - oranges
  - apples
  - bananas
```

Example dictionary

```yaml
fruit:
	name: orange
	price: 2.0
	amount: 500
```

See [the "Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment tutorial" YAML page](https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cicd-github/04-understanding-yaml/index.html) for helpful tips on working with YAML.

A GitHub Actions workflow is a YAML file that tells GitHub what to do automatically when something happens in your repository.

## Common GitHub workflow terminology and definitions:

| Term                  | What it means (plain language)                                        | Example                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Workflow              | A YAML file that defines automated tasks to run in a repository.      | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`        |
| Action                | A reusable unit of code that performs a single task.                  | `actions/checkout@v4`                 |
| Job                   | A group of steps that run together on the same runner.                | `jobs: test:`                         |
| Step                  | An individual command or action executed as part of a job.            | `- run: pytest`                       |
| Runner                | A virtual machine that runs a job.                                    | `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`              |
| Trigger               | An event that starts a workflow.                                      | `on: push`                            |
| `needs`               | Specifies which job(s) must finish successfully before this job runs. | `needs: build`                        |
| `if`                  | A conditional expression that determines whether a job or step runs.  | `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` |
| `name`                | A human-readable label shown in the Actions UI.                       | `name: Run tests`                     |
| `id`                  | A unique identifier used to reference a step or job.                  | `id: build`                           |
| `run`                 | Executes a shell command directly on the runner.                      | `run: pytest -q`                      |
| `uses`                | Runs a prebuilt action or reusable workflow.                          | `uses: actions/checkout@v4`           |
| `with`                | Provides input parameters to an action or reusable workflow.          | `with: python-version: "3.11"`        |
| Environment variables | Key–value pairs available to jobs and steps.                          | `env: MY_VAR=value`                   |

**Workflows contain jobs → jobs contain steps → steps run actions or commands.** Reusable workflows are workflows that call other workflows to avoid repetition.

Remember, workflows define _when_ automation runs, jobs define _what_ runs, steps define _how_ it runs, and actions package reusable functionality that steps can run.

**General structure**

```yaml
name: <name of your workflow>

on: <event or list of events>

jobs:
  job_1:
    name: <name of the first job>
    runs-on: <type of machine to run the job on>
    steps:
      - name: <step 1>
        run: |
          <commands>
      - name: <step 2>
        run: |
          <commands>
  job_2:
    name: <name of the second job>
    runs-on: <type of machine to run the job on>
    steps:
      - name: <step 1>
        run: |
          <commands>
      - name: <step 2>
        run: |
          <commands>
```

## Simple project set up

For this workshop we will consider a GitHub Action workflow with three to four steps:

1. Lint and format
2. (Optional) Test
3. Version
4. Release

In order for the version step to execute correctly, we need a way to indicate a version number. A minimal `pyproject.toml` file will assist in this.

**Brief note on project structure**

The GitHub Actions workflow definition is broken into reusable workflows where there is one workflow per job. We will refer to these reusable workflows as jobs in the context of this workshop as they are intended for you to be able to plug into your own code bases and use. We will indicate when you can re-use a workflow job and what inputs and permissions are required with a 🔍 symbol.

🧰 It should be noted that typically, the jobs are all defined in a single file and there is no need to break these up by job unless you want to reuse specific definition files across repositories and projects. Example file without reusable workflow "jobs": https://github.com/chicago-aiscience/workshop-sst/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml

🧰 Note on terminology: In GitHub Actions, a _reusable workflow_ is technically a workflow that calls another workflow. In this workshop, we refer to these reusable workflows as “jobs” because they behave like plug-in jobs you can reuse across repositories.

## 👉 Step 1. Create a `pyproject.toml`

A single place to define a Python project and how it should be installed and run. It defines details like:

- The name of your project
- The version of your project
- What version of Python is required
- What dependencies your project uses
- (Optionally) How to run as a command-line tool

*Let's add a `pyproject.toml` file to the repository.*

Here is a minimal example:

```toml
[project]
name = "sst"
version = "0.6.6"
description = "A sea surface temperature ML prediction package for workshops (SST + ENSO)."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
license = { text = "MIT" }
authors = [{ name = "Nikki Tebaldi" }]

dependencies = [
  "numpy>=1.26",
  "pandas>=2.1",
  "scikit-learn>=1.3",
  "matplotlib>=3.8",
  "seaborn>=0.13.2",
  "typer>=0.9",
  "ruff>=0.14.10",
  "pytest>=9.0.2",
]

[project.scripts]
sst = "sst.cli:app"
```

****Note the `version` key as that is important for the version GitHub Actions job.***

> 🔍 Checkpoint #1: You can use the following examples as a template to create your own `project.toml` for your code base and fill in the necessary details for the project `[project]`, dependencies, and script entry point `[project.scripts]`.  Then you can implement versioning for your own projects. The minimum requirement for this workshop is to have a `version` key specified.

Steps to add the file to the GitHub repository:

1. Create the file: `touch pyproject.toml`
2. Open the file and copy and paste the above definition
3. Let's change the version to: `0.6.4`
4. Save the file
5. Commit the file to the repository on the `main` branch

```bash
   git add pyproject.toml
   git commit -m "Define a pyproject file that points to a specific version"
```

## Define a GitHub Actions workflow file

*Now let's create a simple GitHub Actions definition file.*

### 👉  **Step 2.** Create a definition file

Make sure you run this from the root of the GitHub repository)

```bash
touch .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

- Notice the other `*.yml` files: There is one per job (e.g., lint-and-format, scan, test, version, release, etc.) defined in the `.github/workflows` directory
- These are reusable workflows and allow us to simplify the workshop but still provide a full example that you can incorporate into your own code bases and are denoted as "(Internal)" so you know they are to be used in a top-level workflow
- See the `.github/workflows/deploy-full-example.yml` file for the entire CI/CD pipeline

### 👉  **Step 3.** Define a name for the workflow and when it should be triggered

Type or copy and paste the following into the top of the `deploy.yml` file

```yaml
name: Deploy SST

on:
  workflow_dispatch:    # Allow for manual trigger
```

🧰 For ease in the workshop we will trigger the workflow manually. But you may want to automate the entire workflow and have it run when you push a commit to the `main` branch. The `deploy-full-example.yml` includes this:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths-ignore:
      - pyproject.toml
      - uv.lock
```

Notice that the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files are ignored. If you only make changes to either of these files, commit, and push them to the GitHub repository they will **not** trigger the workflow.

### 👉 **Step 4.** Define workflow permissions

Add this to the end of the `deploy.yml` file under the `workflow_dispatch` content

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

Permissions control what the GitHub Actions runner is allowed to do on your behalf, such as creating releases or pushing tags. Using the minimum required permissions is a best practice for security and reproducibility.

Some common permissions include:

| Permission               | What it allows                                                 | Typical use in workflows                                             |     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| `actions: read`          | Read information about workflow runs and jobs.                 | Used by tools like CodeQL to report status and gather run metadata.  |     |
| `contents: write`        | Read and modify repository contents (commits, tags, releases). | Required for version bumping, tagging, and creating GitHub releases. |     |
| `packages: write`        | Publish packages to GitHub Package Registry (e.g. GHCR).       | Used to build and push Docker images to `ghcr.io`.                   |     |
| `security-events: write` | Upload security scan results to GitHub.                        | Required for CodeQL code scanning and SARIF uploads.                 |     |

### 👉  **Step 5.** Define the "Lint + Format" job

The "Lint + Format" job maintains code quality over time keeping the code "clean" and formatted through versions.

Add this to the end of the `deploy.yml` file after the permissions:

```yaml
jobs:
  lint-and-format:
    name: Lint + format
    uses: ./.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml
```

- `jobs` defines all of the jobs that will be run and they run in parallel by default. We will explore sequential execution in a little bit.
- `name` provides a human readable name for the job
- `uses` indicates the reusable workflow definition that will be loaded

Let's dive deeper into the full "Lint + Format" reusable workflow definition so we can explore the contents.

```yaml
name: (Internal) Lint and format

on:
    workflow_call:

permissions:
    contents: read

jobs:
  lint-and-format:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4
        with:
          version: "latest"

      - name: Install
        run: uv sync

      - name: Run ruff check
        run: uv run ruff check .

```

- `workflow_call` indicates this is a reusable workflow file and will be triggered when called by another workflow
- `permissions` provides the permissions required by the jobs to run successfully, in this case the contents of the repo can be read
- `jobs` defined the workflow jobs to execute
	- `lint-and-format` defines a single job
	- `runs-on` defines what machine type the job should be run on; many runner types are available and are listed on the ["Standard GitHub-hosted runners for public repositories"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories) section of the docs
	- `steps` are the individual steps that will be executed in the job
		- `name` is the name of the individual step
		- `uses` indicates a specific GitHub Actions to use in a step
		- `with` indicates any parameters that should be passed into the action
		- `run` indicates a specific command to run (helpful if there is no GitHub Actions defined for the task)

This job does the following:

1) It checks out the repository code and makes it available to the GitHub Actions on the runner
2) It sets up `uv` and makes it available to the runner's environment
3) It installs the package dependencies defined in the `pyproject.toml` file
4) It runs `ruff` to lint and format the code

### 👉 **Step 6.** Define a "Version" job

This job solves a common reproducibility problem: how to consistently identify which version of the code produced a specific result.

Add this to the `deploy.yml` file after the "Lint + Format" job:

```yaml
  version:
    name: Compute version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/version.yml
```

- The "Version" job is set up very similarly to the "Lint and Format" job note the use of `name` for the name of the job and `uses` to point to the reusable workflow file

Looking at the job definition file:  `version.yml`

```yaml
name: (Internal) Compute version

on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      app_version:
        description: Computed app version
        value: ${{ jobs.version.outputs.app_version }}

jobs:
  version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      app_version: ${{ steps.release.outputs.app_version != '' && steps.release.outputs.app_version || steps.get_version.outputs.app_version }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4

      - name: Get current version
        id: get_version
        run: |
          echo "app_version=$(uv version | awk '{print $2}')" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Next app version (release)
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/main') || github.base_ref == 'main'
        id: release
        run: |
          uv version --bump patch
          echo "app_version=$(uv version | awk '{print $2}')" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          git checkout pyproject.toml    # reset to original version
          git checkout uv.lock    # reset to original version

```

There are a few key things to notice that differ slightly from the "Lint and Format" job:

1) This job determines the current version of the project and computes what the next version should be
	- It gets the current version using `uv version` and if the branch that triggered the workflow is `main` it then updates the patch version of the project (`0.6.2` --> `0.6.3`): `uv version --bump patch`
2) The structure and use of `workflow_call`, `jobs`, `name`, `uses`, `run` are the same as the "Lint and Format" job
3) The "Version" job uses `id` which is a unique way to identify a step in a job and reference later in the same job. This is useful if the step produces output that can be used by other steps
	- The `id` field uniquely identifies the output from the "Get current version" step and the "Next app version (release)" step
		- *A new version is only created when there is a push to the `main` branch creating a simple versioning scheme to track modifications*
	- The output for each step is saved to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` which is a special path provided by GitHub Actions that step can write output to in the form of key, value pairs
4) `outputs` defines outputs for the entire job and can be referenced by other jobs
	- In the "Version" job the `app_version` is saved so other jobs can reference the correct version
	- The value of the expression that sets the `app_version` looks at the `release` step first to determine if a new version was detected and if not falls back to the `get_version` step

### 👉 **Step 7.** Run the GitHub Actions workflow

Now that you have a complete `deploy.yml` file with the "Lint + Format" and "Version" jobs. Let's explore how to manually trigger the workflow in GitHub.

Please see [[#Workflow set up]] for information on how to trigger a job automatically based on different events. For this workshop, we will manually trigger the workflow to keep things simple.

1. Add and commit the `deploy.yml` file to the `git` repository on the `main` branch:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "GitHub Actions workflow definition with linting, formatting, and version"
```

2. Push the commit up to the GitHub repository

```bash
git push origin main
```

3. Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click on "Actions"

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 12.16.23.png]]


4. You will see all of the workflows listed in the left column (1) and a message indicating that no workflows have been run yet. Click on "Deploy SST" (2) in the left column (this is the name we gave to our `deploy.yml` file)

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 13.21.01.png]]

5. There will be zero workflow runs. Click on "Run workflow" (1), leave the branch to run the workflow on set to `main` (2), and click "Run workflow" (3)

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 13.22.30.png]]

6. You should see the manual execution of the workflow running: `Deploy SST`. Click on "Deploy SST" (1)

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 13.25.22.png]]

7. You can now view the details for the entire workflow

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 13.25.35.png]]

8. You can click on each of the workflow jobs to view the details behind each step

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 13.25.46.png]]

9. You can also view the logs generated for each step in the job

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 13.31.29.png]]

10. The workflow should have executed successfully, indicated by the blue checkmark

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 13.29.50.png]]

## Summary

- You can now create a minimal GitHub Actions workflow that runs automatically in response to changes in a repository.
- You can now define dependencies between jobs and pass information between them using inputs and outputs.
- You have set up a GitHub definition file: `deploy.yml`
- The definition file includes a name, defines when the workflow should be triggered, and includes required permissions for each job
- The definition file includes a "Lint  + Format" job which lints and formats the code base to keep it well organized and formatted over time
- The definition file also includes a "Version" job which increments the patch version of the project with each git push to `main`
- All jobs run in parallel by default and since we did not define any dependencies, the "Lint + Format" and "Version" jobs will execute in parallel
- You ran the first version of the `deploy.yml` file in GitHub

Final file:

```yaml
name: Deploy SST

on:
  workflow_dispatch:    # Allow manual triggering of the workflow

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  # 🔍 Checkpoint #2: Use these jobs in your own project
  lint-and-format:
    name: Lint + format
    uses: ./.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml

  version:
    name: Compute version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/version.yml
```

> 🔍 Checkpoint #2: You can create a `deploy.yml` file for your own project and include the "Lint + Format" and "Version" jobs as they are designed to be reusable across repositories. This is the case for all of the reusable workflow jobs included in the [workshop repository](https://github.com/chicago-aiscience/workshop-github-actions/tree/main/.github/workflows).
>
> Just follow the workflow steps to create your first file and then adapt it to your code base. You may want to update the trigger so the workflow is automatically run when some repository event occurs, like pushing the `main` branch. See [[#Workflow set up]]

Next we will discuss how to introduce dependencies and define sequential job execution, executing on a list of items to generate jobs for each item in the list, and how to download and upload artifacts to communicate between jobs.

# Lesson 3: Job dependencies (sequential execution)

Up until now all of the jobs we defined in the `deploy.yml` file have executed in parallel. But how do we define dependencies between jobs so that they execute sequentially? This lesson will cover how to define a dependency between the first two jobs ("Lint + Format" and "Version") and a new job that we will define to create a GitHub release.

***Objectives:***
- Define a "Release" job that freezes code at its current state and creates a GitHub release
- Understand how to define job dependencies using `needs` and how to communicate between jobs using `with`
- Define a dependency on the "Release" job so that it requires the "Lint + Format" and "Version" jobs to run and complete before execution
- Pass the `app_version` created in the "Version" job to the "Release" job
- Execute and test the final workflow `deploy.yml` in GitHub

### 👉 **Step 8.** Define a "Release" job

The “Release” job ties a specific snapshot of your code to a version, so you can clearly identify which version produced a given set of results.

Add this to the end of the `deploy.yml` file after the "Version" job:

```yaml
  release:
    name: Release version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml
```

This will run the "Release" reusable workflow job which tags and creates a GitHub release. A GitHub release is a published snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time, usually tied to a Git tag. It can include:
- A git tag, like: `v0.6.2`
- Release metadata: The title (often the version), Release notes or a change log, marked to indicate latest release or prerelease
- Optional assets: Compiled binaries, compressed archives of the code base, installers, docs, etc.
- [GitHub releases documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)

🧰 A release allows you to freeze your code and tag it with a specific version. This release can be included in publications to link specific versions and therefore specific states of your code base that produces specific results. It is a great way to provide reproducibility to your codebase, although it is not as convenient as creating and hosting a Docker container image on the GitHub container repository. The container image can be easily pulled down and executed without having to worry about setting up Python library dependencies.

Let's take a deeper look at the `release.yml`:

```yaml
name: (Internal) Release

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      app_version:
        type: string
        required: true

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Setup uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4

      - name: Bump and commit version
        run: |
          uv version ${{ inputs.app_version }}
          git config user.name "${GITHUB_ACTOR}"
          git config user.email "${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com"
          git commit -am "Chore: Bump version to ${{ inputs.app_version }}"
          git push

      - name: Push tag
        run: |
          git config user.name "${GITHUB_ACTOR}"
          git config user.email "${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com"
          git tag -a "v${{ inputs.app_version }}" -m "Version ${{ inputs.app_version }}"
          git push origin "v${{ inputs.app_version }}"

      - name: Create GH release
        uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
        with:
          generateReleaseNotes: true
          name: v${{ inputs.app_version }}
          tag: v${{ inputs.app_version }}

```

This job is set up similarly to the other jobs we have seen so far using the same syntax and components that define a GitHub Actions workflow file.

The "Release" job performs a few tasks in order to create a GitHub release:
1. Defines inputs to the `workflow_call` so that the "Release" job is passed the `app_version` from the "Version" job
2. Check out repository: checks out the repository using a token:
	- `secrets.PAT_TOKEN` - This is a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) that you would create and save to [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets) (we won't delve into this in this workshop as it covers a more advanced use case)
	- `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` - This is a short-lived authentication token that GitHub automatically creates for every workflow run. It lets your GitHub Actions workflow authenticate to the GitHub API as the repository itself. There is no further action needed to use this token.
	- One of these is required because the release step will commit the new version to the code base
2. Set up `uv` so it is available on the runner (underlying machine running the GitHub workflow)
3. Bump and commit the version: This will set the version to the version created by the "Version" job and commit the changes made to the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files which track the current version
4. Push tag - Creates and pushes a tag to the GitHub repository. A [tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) is a named pointer to a specific commit in your repository.
5. Create GH release - Creates the [GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) with release notes, a name, and a tag (which is the same as the tag created in step 3)

### 👉 **Step 9.** Update the permissions for the "Release" job

The permissions in the `release.yml` file are:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

These permissions allow the GitHub Actions workflow to read and modify repository contents (commits, tags, releases). This way the "Release" job can create a GitHub release.

These permissions need to be propagated to the top-level workflow defined in `deploy.yml` in order for the "Release" job can use them.

Modify the `deploy.yml` file permissions which should look like this from the previous steps:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

To:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

### 👉 **Step 10.** Define a job dependency and communicate the version

Now that we have an understanding to the "Release" job, how does it get the version number from the "Version" job and use it to update the version of the project, tag the current commit, and tag the release?

We need to define the dependency between the "Release" job and all other jobs and then we can use that definition to set up the inputs to the "Release" job.

Modify the current "Release" definition in `deploy.yml` to add in `needs` and `with`

```yaml
  release:
    name: Release version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml
    needs: [lint-and-format, version]
    with:
      app_version: ${{ needs.version.outputs.app_version }}
```

`needs` defines what other jobs need to run and complete before the current "Release" job can run. The "Release" job requires the "Version" job to complete before it runs as it requires the `app_version` as input but we also set the `lint-and-format` reference as we don't want to create a "Release" without running the "Lint + Format" job on the code base. This way we know the code is well formatted before freezing it in the release process.

`with` provides input parameters to the "Release" job and connects the output of the "Version" job to the input of the "Release" job. The value references the `needs` field and in particular the `version` job outputs to retrieve the `app_version` from the "Version" job. Remember we had defined the outputs of the "Version" job like so:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      app_version:
        description: Computed app version
        value: ${{ jobs.version.outputs.app_version }}
```

And the inputs of the "Release" job like so:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      app_version:
        type: string
        required: true
```

**Tying it all together**, we:
1) Defined the `app_version` output in the "Version" job
2) Defined the `app_version` input in the "Release" job
3) Defined the `release` job in the `deploy.yml` file and set it's dependency on the "Version" job using the `needs` field
4) Defined the `app_version` input to the "Release" job using `with`

### 👉 **Step 11.** Execute a job conditionally using `if`

We now have a "Lint + Format", "Version", and "Release" jobs. The "Lint + Format" and "Version" jobs execute in parallel while the "Release" job executes sequentially after both jobs are complete. Here is the current definition file:

```yaml
name: Deploy SST

on:
  workflow_dispatch:    # Allow manual triggering of the workflow

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  lint-and-format:
    name: Lint + format
    uses: ./.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml

  version:
    name: Compute version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/version.yml

  release:
    name: Release version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml
    needs: [lint-and-format, version]
    with:
      app_version: ${{ needs.version.outputs.app_version }}
```

What if the "Version" job fails to create the `app_version`, would we still want to create a "Release"? Probably not, as this might create an incomplete release that doesn't accurately capture the current state of the project and the version. This is where the conditional expression `if` comes in.

Add the `if` key to the "Release" job in the `deploy.yml` file so the "Release" job only runs if the "Version" job completed successfully and the `app_version` variable is populated:

```yaml
  release:
    name: Release version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml
    needs: [lint-and-format, version]
    if: needs.version.result == 'success' && needs.version.outputs.app_version != ''
    with:
      app_version: ${{ needs.version.outputs.app_version }}
```


## 👉 **Step 12.**  Commit, push, and execute the updated workflow

We can test the workflow now that you have an updated `deploy.yml` with the "Release" job, dependencies, and `app_version` inputs/outputs defined.

Updated `deploy.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Deploy SST

on:
  workflow_dispatch:    # Allow manual triggering of the workflow

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  lint-and-format:
    name: Lint + format
    uses: ./.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml

  version:
    name: Compute version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/version.yml

  release:
    name: Release version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml
    needs: [lint-and-format, version]
    if: needs.version.result == 'success' && needs.version.outputs.app_version != ''
    with:
      app_version: ${{ needs.version.outputs.app_version }}
```

Let's test the workflow by committing, pushing, and executing the workflow.

1. Commit the modified file

```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add a release step to freeze code base at a specific version"
```

2. Push the commit up to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

3. Go to the GitHub "Actions" tab for the project repository

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 13.39.45.png]]

4. Run the "Deploy SST" workflow. See [[#👉 **Step 7.** Run the GitHub Actions workflow]] for details on how to execute the workflow manually

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 13.46.09.png]]

5. If you click on the workflow, you are directed to the "Summary" page where you will see the jobs executing. You should see the "Lint + Format" and "Compute version" job execute in parallel and then the "Release" job should execute sequentially.

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 13.47.51.png]]

6. Click on the "Release version/release" job, you should see all of the "Release" job steps completed successfully. Feel free to explore each step's logs

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 13.48.51.png]]

7. Verify the release was created. Navigate to the home page of the repository and look for the "Releases" section in the right column

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 14.41.56.png]]

8. Click on the version tag, (e.g., `v0.6.6`) to view the full release details

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 14.42.12.png]]
- You can view the full change log of commits or you can download compressed archives of the repository code base

## Summary

- You can now tie a specific version of your code to a release so you can identify which version produced a given set of results.
- You defined a "Release" job that creates a GitHub release and freezes your code base at its current state
- You updated the permissions to the "Release" job so it can write to the contents of the repository
- You defined a job dependency between the "Lint + Format" job, the "Version" job, and the "Release" job so that the "Release" job will only execute after the previous two have completed
- You only execute the "Release" job if the "Version" job completed successfully and returns an `app_version`
- You pushed these changes to GitHub and tested the workflow

Final `deploy.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Deploy SST

on:
  workflow_dispatch:    # Allow manual triggering of the workflow

# 🔍 Checkpoint #3: Update the permissions to aggregate all required from reusable workflow files
permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  lint-and-format:
    name: Lint + format
    uses: ./.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml

  version:
    name: Compute version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/version.yml

  release:
    name: Release version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml
    # 🔍 Checkpoint #4: Define for any or all of the jobs you define in the deploy.yml file
    needs: [lint-and-format, version]
    if: needs.version.result == 'success' && needs.version.outputs.app_version != ''
    with:
      app_version: ${{ needs.version.outputs.app_version }}
```


> 🔍 Checkpoint #3: You can use any of the workflows listed as "(Internal)" in the `.github/workflows` directory in your own code base but you will need to aggregate the permissions across all of these files and define them in the top-level `deploy.yml`. If you use all of the files the permissions would look like this:
```yaml
permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: write
  packages: write
  security-events: read
```
> See [[#👉 **Step 4.** Define workflow permissions]] for info on each of these permissions

> 🔍 Checkpoint #4: You can modify the `needs` field to include any of the jobs you may define in the `deploy.yml` and to suit your expectations of how the workflow jobs should run. For example, you may want to implement security scanning into your workflow, so you add in the "Scan" job (`scan.yml`). But you don't want require the "Release" job to run before the code is scanned so you leave that out of the `needs` list. (Although it is probably a good idea to freeze your code base on code that does not have vulnerabilities.)

# Lesson 4: Executing on a list using `matrix` and using artifacts - BONUS

This lesson also includes some extra bonus content on two other helpful GitHub Actions features: 1) Executing tests on multiple Python versions using `matrix` and 2) How to upload and download artifacts to communicate between jobs.

***Objectives***
- Define a "Test" job that executes on multiple versions of Python using the `matrix` strategy
- Understand how to upload artifacts so other jobs can access files created by job steps
- Understand how to download artifacts in a job and access the downloaded file

## 👉 **Step 14.** Update `pyproject.toml` to include a build system so tests can be run

Modify the `pyproject.toml` and replace the contents with this version:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=68", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "sst"
version = "0.6.6"
description = "A sea surface temperature ML prediction package for workshops (SST + ENSO)."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
license = { text = "MIT" }
authors = [{ name = "Nikki Tebaldi" }]

dependencies = [
  "numpy>=1.26",
  "pandas>=2.1",
  "scikit-learn>=1.3",
  "matplotlib>=3.8",
  "seaborn>=0.13.2",
  "typer>=0.9",
  "ruff>=0.14.10",
  "pytest>=9.0.2",
]

[project.scripts]
sst = "sst.cli:app"

[tool.setuptools]
package-dir = { "" = "src" }
```

This adds a `[build-system]` section which allows the `sst` repository to be installed as a package and used in the execution of the tests. We won't dive into this too far as there could be a whole other workshop on Python packaging.

## 👉 **Step 15.** Define a "Test" job that executes on multiple versions of Python

Update the `deploy.yml` file to include the "Test" job (`test.yml`)

```yaml
test:
  name: Tests
  uses: ./.github/workflows/test.yml
```

Update the "Release" job in the `deploy.yml` to require the `test` job before executing. This way we are creating a release after the successful execution of the tests:

```yaml
  release:
    name: Release version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml
    needs: [lint-and-format, version, test]
    if: needs.version.result == 'success'
    with:
      app_version: ${{ needs.version.outputs.app_version }}
```

Let's take a look at the `test.yml` file:

```yaml
name: (Internal) Test

on:
  workflow_call:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10","3.11","3.12"]
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4
        with:
          version: "latest"
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Install
        run: uv sync

      - name: Check Python version
        run: uv run python --version

      - name: Execute tests
        run: uv run pytest -q

      - name: Create predictions plot
        run: uv run python -m sst.cli --start 2000-01

      - name: Upload plot
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: trends-${{ matrix.python-version }}
          path: artifacts/ml_predictions.png
```

The "Test" job executes the unit tests defined in the `tests` directory using `pytest` by:

1. Defining a `strategy` that uses a `matrix` of Python versions. A strategy defines how a job is executed while a matrix is a way to run the same job multiple times with different inputs. See [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/run-job-variations) for more info. This means the "Test" job will be executed three times (one for each Python version)
	- 🧰 This is a great way to test that your code is compatible with multiple Python versions if you want to support more than one version amongst collaborators
2. The job checks out the current code in the repository
3. Then it sets up `uv` using the Python version defined in the matrix, `with` points to the specific matrix element that workflow is executing on : `matrix.python-version`
4. `uv` is then used to install dependencies needed by the tests and then runs the tests using `pytest`
5. The Python version is printed out as a test to ensure the `matrix` definition is working as intended
6. We will discuss the creation of the predictions plot and upload in the section on "Artifacts"

🧰 Step 3 works well for our example because we use `uv` to run each test command. If you want to make a specific Python version available to all installed tools on the runner use the `actions.setup-python@v5`:

```yaml
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
```

## 👉 **Step 16.** Commit, push, and execute the updated workflow

We can test the updated `deploy.yml` file to see if multiple "Test" jobs are run on the three defined Python versions.

Full `deploy.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Deploy SST

on:
  workflow_dispatch:    # Allow manual triggering of the workflow

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  lint-and-format:
    name: Lint + format
    uses: ./.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml

  version:
    name: Compute version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/version.yml

  release:
    name: Release version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml
    needs: [lint-and-format, version]
    if: needs.version.result == 'success' && needs.version.outputs.app_version != ''
    with:
      app_version: ${{ needs.version.outputs.app_version }}

  test:
    name: Tests
    uses: ./.github/workflows/test.yml

```

1. Commit and push recent changes to GitHub

```yaml
# Pull recent changes to `main` as this may have been modified by the "Release" job
git pull origin main

# Commit and push recent changes
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml pyproject.toml
git commit -m "Define a 'Test' job to execute on multiple Python versions"
git push origin main
```

2. Test the workflow in GitHub. See [[#👉 **Step 7.** Run the GitHub Actions workflow]] for details on how to run the workflow.

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 14.56.35.png]]

3. Once the workflow has executed, review the "Test" jobs that were created and executed by clicking on "3 jobs completed" > "Tests/ test (3.12)"

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 15.00.32.png]]

4.  Look at the logs for the "Check Python version" step and see that the Python version was: `Python 3.12.3`

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 15.01.01.png]]

Feel free to view the logs for the other versions to make sure things look correct.

## 👉 **Step 17.** Download the artifacts created in the "Test" jobs

In step 15, we covered how to run tests on multiple Python versions and each of these versions uploads a plot created by the execution of the `sst` program.

"Test" job definition highlight the upload operation:

```yaml
      - name: Upload plot
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: trends-${{ matrix.python-version }}
          path: artifacts/ml_predictions.png
```

The `actions/upload-artifact@v4` takes files created during a job and saves them as downloadable artifacts attached to that workflow run. If you go back to the "Summary" page of the GitHub Actions workflow you executed in step 16, you should see "Artifacts" listed at the bottom of the summary.

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 15.10.07.png]]

You can download them and review the plots. But what if you wanted to use these files in another GitHub Actions workflow job? Let's create a toy example that downloads the artifacts to a job (`download-artifact.yml`) and lists the available files after download.

Add the "Download Test Artifacts" job to the `deploy.yml` file:

```yaml
  download-artifacts:
    name: Download test artifacts
    needs: test
    uses: ./.github/workflows/download-artifact.yml
```

- The `needs` is critical as it this job needs to run after the artifacts have been created and uploaded

Let's review the `download-artifact.yml` file:

```yaml
name: (Internal)Download Test Artifacts

on:
  workflow_call:

jobs:
  download-artifacts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download artifact for Python 3.10
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: trends-3.10
          path: artifacts/python-3.10

      - name: Download artifact for Python 3.11
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: trends-3.11
          path: artifacts/python-3.11

      - name: Download artifact for Python 3.12
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: trends-3.12
          path: artifacts/python-3.12

      - name: List downloaded artifacts
        run: |
          echo "Downloaded artifacts:"
          find artifacts -type f -name "*.png" || echo "No PNG files found"
          ls -la artifacts/*/ || echo "No artifact directories found"

```

- This workflow job uses the `actions/download-artifact@v4` GitHub Action to download the plots from the previous test jobs
- `with` defines the `name` of the plot and sets the `path` to download the plot to
- The final step lists the available downloads to show the plots have been downloaded

## 👉 **Step 18.** Commit, push, and execute the updated workflow

Let's test the final workflow to see if the plots get downloaded.

Final `deploy.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Deploy SST

on:
  workflow_dispatch:    # Allow manual triggering of the workflow

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  lint-and-format:
    name: Lint + format
    uses: ./.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml

  version:
    name: Compute version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/version.yml

  test:
    name: Tests
    uses: ./.github/workflows/test.yml

  download-artifacts:
    name: Download test artifacts
    needs: test
    uses: ./.github/workflows/download-artifact.yml

  release:
    name: Release version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml
    needs: [lint-and-format, version, test]
    if: needs.version.result == 'success' && needs.version.outputs.app_version != ''
    with:
      app_version: ${{ needs.version.outputs.app_version }}

```
- Note the order has been changed so that the steps are listed in the order they execute
- The `download-artifacts` and `release` job can execute in parallel as they don't require any data from each other to execute

1. Commit and push the recent modifications to GitHub

```yaml
git pull origin main    # Pull down any release changes
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add toy example to download artifacts from Test jobs"
git push origin main
```

2. Execute the workflow in GitHub, see [[#👉 **Step 7.** Run the GitHub Actions workflow]] for details on how to execute

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 15.22.29.png]]

3. After execution completes, verify the plots were downloaded by clicking on "Downlo.../download-artifacts and viewing the logs for the "List downloaded artifacts" step

![[Screenshot 2025-12-23 at 15.24.26.png]]

* The "Download Test Artifacts" job downloaded all three `ml_predictions.png` plots for each Python version executed by the test

## Summary

- You can now run workflows across multiple environments and share files between jobs using artifacts.
- You updated the `pyproject.toml` file to include a build system so that the `sst` package can be built and executed by the tests
- You defined a "Test" job that executes in parallel on multiple versions of Python using the `matrix` strategy
- You tested the "Test" job execution and viewed the logs for the steps to see what version was executing
- You defined a "Download Test Artifacts" job that downloads the plots uploaded by the "Test" jobs
- You tested the "Download Test Artifacts" job execution and viewed the list of downloaded plots on the file system

Final `deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy SST

on:
  workflow_dispatch:    # Allow manual triggering of the workflow

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  lint-and-format:
    name: Lint + format
    uses: ./.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml

  version:
    name: Compute version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/version.yml

  test:
    name: Tests
    uses: ./.github/workflows/test.yml

  download-artifacts:
    name: Download test artifacts
    needs: test
    uses: ./.github/workflows/download-artifact.yml

  release:
    name: Release version
    uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml
    needs: [lint-and-format, version, test]
    if: needs.version.result == 'success' && needs.version.outputs.app_version != ''
    with:
      app_version: ${{ needs.version.outputs.app_version }}
```

# Lessons Summary

In this workshop, you learned how GitHub Actions workflows can be used to support reproducible science by tying code changes to concrete, versioned outputs. Starting from a complete example, you explored how automated workflows (commonly used in software development) can be adapted to scientific codebases that may not follow traditional packaging or deployment patterns.

You began by reviewing a full GitHub Actions workflow to understand the major components and how they fit together. From there, you worked through a simplified example step by step, creating your own workflow definition file and gradually adding functionality. Along the way, you defined a minimal `pyproject.toml` to support versioning, implemented automated linting and formatting to maintain code quality, and added a versioning step to track changes to the codebase over time.

You then introduced job dependencies and conditional execution to ensure that releases are only created when earlier steps complete successfully. By passing information between jobs using outputs and inputs, you connected specific versions of the code to GitHub releases providing a clear mechanism for freezing and referencing the state of the code that produced a given result.

In the bonus sections, you extended these ideas further by running tests across multiple Python versions using a matrix strategy and by uploading and downloading artifacts to share files between jobs. These examples demonstrate how GitHub Actions can capture not just code, but also execution results, making it easier to reproduce analyses, regenerate figures, and validate results in the future.

By the end of the workshop, you should feel comfortable reading and modifying GitHub Actions workflows, understanding how the pieces fit together, and adapting the provided examples to your own projects. The goal is not to memorize syntax, but to leave with a working mental model and practical patterns you can reuse to make your scientific workflows more reproducible and maintainable.

## Key takeaways

- GitHub Actions workflows provide a practical way to automate common tasks (linting, testing, versioning, releasing) in scientific codebases.
- A workflow defines when automation runs, jobs define what runs, and steps define how it runs.
- A workflow is a YAML file that defines *when* automation runs and *what* steps are executed.
- Workflows are made up of jobs, jobs are made up of steps, and steps run either commands or reusable actions.
- Job dependencies and conditional execution allow you to control when tasks run and prevent incomplete or invalid releases.
- Versioning and releases provide a clear way to tie specific states of the codebase to results used in publications.

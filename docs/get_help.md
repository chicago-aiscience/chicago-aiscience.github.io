title: Get Help <Start Here>
---

There are many ways to get support, and you’re always welcome to reach out. I’m happy to talk through your ideas and help figure out the best way to move forward together. The Services section on the Goals & Services page provides an overview of how I can help and offers a helpful starting point.

You’ll find details about open office hours below, which are a great way to have a short conversation, ask questions, and explore potential collaborations. For larger or longer-term projects, the project intake form helps me better understand your needs and prioritize support.

# Project Intake

In addition to office hours, we use a project intake form to help guide larger or longer-term research software engineering projects and collaborations.

The form collects information about your technical goals, timelines, and software needs so we can better understand the scope of the work and plan appropriate support.

Submitting the intake form helps ensure that requests are aligned with Fellowship expectations and allows us to prioritize effort, coordinate resources, and set realistic next steps for sustained collaboration.
